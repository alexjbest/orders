Finding orders with prescribed index in number fields
=====================================================

This repository contains work for my third year Discrete Maths project at Warwick University (more or less equivalent to a Bachelors thesis).

The aim of this project was to develop algorithms for finding orders of a given index in number fields, and it was supervised by Dr. Lassina D√©m√le.

This repository contains Sage and Magma scripts for doing some of these and related computations along with the various reports and specifications submitted for the project.
